## 📘 What is OOP?
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around **objects** rather than functions and logic.
These **objects** are instances of **classes**, and they can hold both **data (attributes)** and **behaviour (methods/functions)**.

### 📦 Why OOP?
- Makes code **modular**, **reusable**, and **maintainable**
- Supports **real-world modeling** (e.g., A "Car" can be a class with color, speed, etc.)
- Encourages **encapsulation**, **abstraction**, and **modularity**
### 💬 Key Concepts in Simple Terms

|Concept|Real-Life Analogy|
|---|---|
|**Class**|Blueprint of a car|
|**Object**|Actual car made from the blueprint|
|**Encapsulation**|Car hiding engine details behind the steering wheel|
|**Abstraction**|You can drive without knowing how the engine works|
|**Inheritance**|An electric car inherits from the regular car|
|**Polymorphism**|You press "start" on both petrol and electric cars, but they behave differently internally|
### ✅ Interview Tip:
> Be ready to answer: **“What is OOP?”**, and follow up with **“Why is it useful in software development?”**  
 Use real-life analogies + one-liner definitions for clarity.
### 🧠 One-Liner Summary:

> OOP models code like the real world — using classes and objects — to make it **organized**, **flexible**, and **reusable**.
