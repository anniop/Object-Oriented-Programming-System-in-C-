### 👨‍💻 Coding / Design-Based Practice

11. Create a class `Employee` with private members and getter/setter functions. 
12. Implement a `Shape` abstract class and `Rectangle`, `Circle` subclasses with area() methods. 
13. Demonstrate function overloading in a class `Print`. 
14. Demonstrate function overriding with `Animal` and `Dog` classes. 
15. Create a class with static variable `count` that increases every time an object is created. 
16. Show use of a copy constructor. 
17. Use `this` pointer in a setter function. 
18. Write a virtual destructor in a base class. 
19. Use a friend function to access a private member.
20. Implement a simple class to simulate a bank account system.

### 🎯 Design / Application Level

21. Design a ride sharing system (Uber clone) — identify at least 5 classes.
22. Explain how OOP helps in real-world app development.
23. What changes if you remove `virtual` from the base class?
24. What’s the difference between class vs struct in C++?
25. Create an abstract `Appliance` class and derive `Fan`, `AC`, and `Heater`.
