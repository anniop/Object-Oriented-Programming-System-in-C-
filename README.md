# 🚀 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Notes for Interviews

Welcome! 👋  
These are my **personal OOP notes** made while preparing for placement interviews.  
They are super detailed, well-structured, and focused specifically on **C++ with real interview questions** in mind.

## 💡 Why I Made This

While preparing for interviews, I realized that most online resources either:
- Weren't organized for revision
- Missed practical examples
- Didn't align with what companies really ask

So I built this from scratch, and now I'm sharing it with all of you. 🙌
